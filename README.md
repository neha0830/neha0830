## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a recent MBA graduate with a focus on finance, I am passionate about leveraging my academic knowledge and analytical skills to drive financial decision-making and business growth. 
During my studies and internships, I gained hands-on experience in financial modeling, data analysis, business analysis, and strategic planning. 
My goal is to contribute to a dynamic organization where I can apply these skills and continue to develop professionally.
